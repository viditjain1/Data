# Data
All the data analysis related work/practice i've done

1: New York: I took the dataset(link: http://chriswhong.com/open-data/liberating-data-from-nyc-property-tax-bills/) containing
            information about the property taxes of 1.1 million lots in New York City. I used this dataset to practice various
            matplotlib and pandas tools.
